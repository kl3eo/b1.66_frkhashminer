> Expanse (frkhash) miner with OpenCL, CUDA and stratum support


**frkminer** is an Frkhash GPU mining application: with frkminer you can mine every coin which relies on an Frkhash Proof of Work.

This is a direct descendent of the Ethminer project at https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer. Since that project
is largely abandoned and unmanaged this personal version is published with the hope that it may continue to be useful. In the spirit
of open source problem reports and pull requests are welcome, but please use git-clang-format on your requests.
